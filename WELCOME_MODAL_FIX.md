# Welcome Modal Fix

## Issue
The welcome modal was being shown to existing users who had already logged in before, causing confusion and poor user experience.

## Root Cause
The original logic in `useModalManager.ts` was showing the welcome modal for:
1. Users who had never logged in (`first_login_at === null`) **OR**
2. Users created in the last 7 days (regardless of whether they had logged in before)

This meant that any user created within the past week would see the welcome modal every time they logged in, even if they weren't truly first-time users.

## Solution
Updated the logic to only show the welcome modal for **truly first-time users**:

### Key Changes in `useModalManager.ts`:

1. **Simplified Logic**: Removed the "recent user" condition and only check for `first_login_at === null`
2. **Persistent Dismissal**: Changed from session storage to local storage to permanently dismiss modals per user
3. **Specific Modal Tracking**: Track welcome and admin modals separately

### Updated Logic:
```typescript
// Only show welcome modal for first-time users (never logged in before)
if (!isAdmin && isFirstTimeUser && !localStorage.getItem(welcomeModalKey)) {
    setModalState(prev => ({ ...prev, showWelcomeModal: true }));
} else if (isAdmin && isFirstTimeUser && !localStorage.getItem(adminModalKey)) {
    // Show admin updates modal for first-time admin users
    setModalState(prev => ({ ...prev, showAdminModal: true }));
}
```

### Backend Integration
The system already has proper backend support:
- `TrackUserLogin` middleware properly sets `first_login_at` on first login
- Users created via seeder have `first_login_at` as `null` initially
- Once a user logs in for the first time, `first_login_at` is set and modal won't show again

## Testing Scenarios

### ✅ Should Show Welcome Modal:
- Brand new user created today, never logged in before
- User created yesterday, never logged in before
- User created a week ago, never logged in before

### ❌ Should NOT Show Welcome Modal:
- User who logged in yesterday (already seen the modal)
- User created a week ago who has logged in multiple times
- Admin users (they get admin modal instead)
- Users who previously dismissed the modal

## Result
- New users get a proper welcome experience
- Existing users are no longer bothered with welcome modals
- Better user experience and reduced confusion
- Persistent modal dismissal across browser sessions
